## About

I am a quantitatively driven researcher focused on building statistically and analytically grounded models for financial markets.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Quantitative research and systematic trading  
- Machine learning–driven decision systems  
- Statistical modeling and probabilistic thinking  
- Risk-aware portfolio construction  
- Data-driven market analysis  

I am deeply interested in how rigorous mathematical frameworks, computational methods, and empirical validation can be combined to extract signal from complex market environments.
